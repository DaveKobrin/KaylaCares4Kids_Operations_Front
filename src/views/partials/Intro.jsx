                        Kayla Cares 4 Kids' mission is to help sick kids feel better by providing entertainment and educational items to children's 
                        hospitals, Ronald McDonald Houses and related pediatric facilities worldwide.

                        Founder and Chief Kid Officer Kayla Abramowitz began the organization at the age of 11. She knew what it was like to spend 
                        countless days in hospitals after being diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, Juvenile Arthritis and Eosinophilic Colitis. Kayla 
                        discovered the lack of recreational activities in place to offset the fear, pain and boredom hospital patients with chronic 
                        illnesses often experience.
                    </p>

                        Through Kayla’s efforts, Kayla Cares 4 Kids helps raise the spirit of young patients by identifying and providing what they 
                        need to stay engaged and motivated during their recovery process.
